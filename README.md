# Embedded Linux Seminar at OST - Ostschweizer Fachhochschule

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Summer School Seminar on Embedded Software Development under Linux at OST - Ostschweizer Fachhochschule, Buchs SG.

## Overview

In today's technologically-driven landscape, networked embedded systems have found applications in numerous sectors ranging from MedTech, IoT, mechatronics, electronics, data science, to environmental technology and photonics. These systems capture and process physical information, transmitting it as required, and influencing the environment based on the processed data. As such, understanding the intricacies of embedded software development is vital for modern-day engineers. While a myriad of libraries are available for various devices, there's a need for engineers to be adept at sourcing, developing, utilizing, and testing software across different platforms.

## Course Contents and Objectives

This seminar seeks to provide attendees with hands-on experience in Linux-based embedded software development through target-oriented examples.

**Key Areas of Focus Include**:
- Introduction to software development: From the basics of version control systems to fundamental operating system concepts.
- Software languages: Delving into popular languages like C/C++ and Python, and the nuances of translating them to different target platforms.
- Practical demonstrations: Showcasing libraries from diverse sectors.
- System programming tools: Focusing on widely-used tools like Make and CMake.

**What You Will Learn**:
1. Basics of Linux and shell programming.
2. Understanding of Binutils, compilers, and libraries.
3. Mastery of Make and CMake.
4. Nuances of version control, with an emphasis on git.
5. Distinction between native and cross development.
6. Writing basic programs in C/C++ and Python.
7. Networking concepts, including static and dynamic IP addresses, WLAN, and UDP.
8. Grasping the concepts of bootloaders, kernels, device trees, and drivers.
9. Working with exemplary sensors.
10. Introduction to image processing using opencv.
